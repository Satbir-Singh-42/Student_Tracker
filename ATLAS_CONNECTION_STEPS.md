You can see one user document:
- **_id**: ObjectId("687a2fb4d4d3fcd9fccb90e8")
- **name**: "Test Student"
- **email**: "teststudent@example.com" 
- **password**: (hashed with bcrypt)
- **role**: "student"
- **profileImage**: null
- **createdAt**: 2025-07-18T11:26:37.378+00:00
- **updatedAt**: 2025-07-18T11:26:37.378+00:00

## How to Check All Collections:

### 1. **Users Collection** (Currently Viewing)
- Click on "users" in the left sidebar
- Shows all user accounts (students, teachers, admins)
- Each user has: name, email, password (hashed), role, timestamps

### 2. **Student Profiles Collection**

## Navigation Tips:

### **View Documents:**
- Each collection shows documents (rows) on the right side
- Use the pagination at the bottom to see more documents
- Click on any document to expand and view full details

### **Filter/Search:**
- Use the "Filter" box at the top to search
- Examples:

  - `{"email": "test@example.com"}` - Find specific user
  - `{"status": "Verified"}` - Show verified achievements

### **Query Examples:**
```json
// Find all students
{"role": "student"}

// Find specific department
{"department": "Computer Science"}

// Find pending achievements
{"status": "Pending"}

// Find achievements by student
{"studentId": "687a2fb4d4d3fcd9fccb90e8"}
```
