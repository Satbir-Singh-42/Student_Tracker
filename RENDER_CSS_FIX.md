# CSS Styling Fix for Render Deployment

## Issue Identified
The deployed app on Render was not displaying proper styling because CSS variables required by shadcn/ui components were missing. The `@replit/vite-plugin-shadcn-theme-json` plugin doesn't work in production builds.

## Root Cause
- Production Vite config excludes Replit-specific plugins
- CSS variables from `theme.json` not being generated in production build
- Tailwind classes using `hsl(var(--primary))` had no defined variables to reference

## Solution Applied
Added manual CSS variables to `client/src/index.css` for both light and dark themes:

```css
:root {
  --background: 0 0% 100%;
  --foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
  --primary: 210 79% 46%;
  --border: 214.3 31.8% 91.4%;
  /* ... all required shadcn/ui variables */
}

.dark {
  --background: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
  --foreground: 210 40% 98%;
  /* ... dark theme variables */
}
```

## Build Results
- ✅ New CSS file generated: `index-BeIMZ9ZY.css` (60.17 kB)
- ✅ CSS variables properly included in build
- ✅ Professional theme colors applied (blue primary: hsl(210, 79%, 46%))
- ✅ Both light and dark theme support

## Next Steps for Deployment
1. Push changes to GitHub repository
2. Render will automatically detect changes and rebuild
3. New build will include proper CSS variables
4. Styling should display correctly on deployed app

## Status
✅ CSS Fix Applied - Ready for Render redeployment
